  - questionText: '[Family] Haven''t you thought about starting a family?'

  - questionText: "[Job] Why\u2019re you hunting rogue AIs?"
    response: The streets are already dangerous enough.  We don't need extra problems
      with AI that can hack us at any time for their own benefit.
    asked: 0
  - questionText: '[Opinion] What do you think of AI?'
    response: It doesn't matter what I think. Rogue AIs pose a threat to citizens
      and the entire world order. We have barely recovered from the last war with
      the machines. There's no point in repeating it.
