  Dialogues:
  - questionText: <b>[Family]</b> How did you lose your husband?
    response: He was stationed at a base that got overtaken by the AI forces. There
      was no chance for him or his unit. It's hard to talk about it.
    asked: 0
  - questionText: <b>[Job]</b> Are you satisfied with your job?
    response: It's fine. I get to create and that helps me cope, in a way. But it's
      not the same as having someone to share it with.
    asked: 0
  - questionText: <b>[Society]</b> Can and should humans coexist with AI?
    response: Maybe in a controlled environment, like how the government handles
      it. But in everyday life? No, I don't believe we should risk it.
    asked: 0
  - questionText: <b>[War]</b> Will people survive another Cyber War?
    response: I don't think so. We've barely recovered from the last one. Another
      war would likely be the end of us.
    asked: 0
  - questionText: <b>[Opinion]</b> Does AI violate human security?
    response: Yes, it does. The fact that we need such stringent measures to control
      it shows how dangerous it can be. Our security is always at risk.
