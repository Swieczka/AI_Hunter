  Dialogues:
  - questionText: '[Family] You''re young and no girlfriend. Why so?'
    response: Don't need one. I live how I want and do what I want. No obligations.
      This is a luxury I can afford. And which I recommend.
    asked: 0
  - questionText: '[Job] You like doing what you do, right?'
    response: Do I like it? No. Love it. I'm better off than most people in this
      country and there's no way something can change that. It can only get better
      and better.
    asked: 0
  - questionText: '[Society] Can humans and AI live side by side?'
    response: They already live that, one way or another. AI is everywhere. In banking
      systems, communications, medicine, national security, and so on. We live with
      it every day. And if we abuse this relationship, it'll only be our fault.
    asked: 0
  - questionText: '[War] Aren''t you afraid of another Cyber War?'
    response: They say that war is when the young and stupid die because of the incompetence
      of the old. I'd say, they die because of their own stupidity in not being able
      to make money from it. In war you'll sell anything, even against AI. There's
      money in the air and I like taking deep breaths.
    asked: 0
  - questionText: '[Opinion] Is AI a threat?'
    response: Depends on what you're asking. Can it destroy markets and governments
      around the world?  Probably so. Can it take advantage of the poor?  Everyone
      does it. AI is as much a threat to the world as you and me. We just have to
      be prepared.
